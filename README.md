# WIO
Weather Station

## Installation

- Get latest Arduino IDE (I am using 1.6.8)
- Install board for ESP8266
- cd to ~/Arduino directory
- clone this repo using "git clone git@github.com:secluded/WIO.git"
- In Arduino library manager look for Adafruit BMP085 libary and the Adafruit DHT library. We are just using regular libraries for now (not unified)
